# .NET Security Vulnerabilities - Educational Application

 This application contains intentionally vulnerable code for educational purposes only!

This is an interactive educational project that demonstrates common security vulnerabilities in .NET applications. Each vulnerability is reproduced in a real working .NET environment where you can debug, explore, and understand what NOT to do, along with recommended secure practices.

## Learning Process

- **Learn by Example**: See real vulnerable code in action
- **Debug and Explore**: Step through vulnerable code paths
- **Learn Best Practices**: Each example includes secure alternatives
- **CWE (Common Weakness Enumeration) References**: Every vulnerability links to official CWE documentation for pro insights
